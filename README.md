# Private Skills

Private Skills is a registry, pull-through proxy, and cross-platform installer for AI agent skills and curated skill packs. The repository now contains an implemented baseline: a TanStack Start/Router web surface, a Nitro request handler, portable TypeScript contracts and services, a worker/scan boundary, Files SDK storage adapters, and a Rust `pskills` client.

## Current status

The private [v0.3.0 release](https://github.com/andymac4182/private-skills/releases/tag/v0.3.0)
is published, with independent archive/fresh-download verification for four
assets, all three target builds, and a Mac two-member inert fixture
install/verify/warm repeat. The current Git-triggered registry, builder, and
upload-reviewer production applications were READY at the last recorded remote check; source and deployment IDs
are recorded in [`docs/verification-current.md`](docs/verification-current.md).
Work now continues directly on local `main`, with pushes and deployments paused
at the owner's request. The earlier Vercel quota rejection is historical and
has not been rechecked during this local phase. Current local checks are in
[`docs/evidence/local-refinement-20260913.md`](docs/evidence/local-refinement-20260913.md).

Native CI was waived by explicit repository-owner instruction on 13 September
2026 for this delivery/review scope. Workflows remain enabled and no native
target pass is claimed; the verification record covers the local Mac package,
Linux-container, and Windows-Wine evidence and their compatibility limits.

M6 and M7 remain incomplete, and the future MCP/context and other product work
is tracked in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md). Detailed C1, M6, M7,
deployment, scanner, schedule, and restore evidence is kept in
[`docs/verification-current.md`](docs/verification-current.md).

| Area | Current status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web registry surface | Implemented with TanStack Start/Router, React, and native CSS | Uses live same-origin API data and reports loading, empty, and error states |
| Registry API | Implemented as a portable `Request`/`Response` handler with Nitro adapters | Directory lookups are bounded; workers acquire and scan release artifacts, and uploaded content is never executed |
| Authentication | Implemented bearer-token bootstrap and signed `HttpOnly` browser sessions | Primary user login remains token-based; the current guarded rollout uses the existing server-side skills.sh Vercel project OIDC path, while device flow/interactive identity providers are not part of this baseline |
| Artifacts | Implemented bounded canonical `pskills-bundle-v1` JSON, digest checks, private sealed-object storage, and transfer grants | Bundle content is data; the registry never runs skill scripts or install hooks |
| State | Implemented file state for a single API process, PostgreSQL JSONB transactions, and an authenticated HTTP CAS repository | The selected state provider and recovery procedure are deployment configuration |
| Storage | Implemented Files SDK filesystem/provider adapters and an authenticated HTTP gateway | Each provider still needs its own credentials and conformance evidence before production use |
| Jobs and scanning | Implemented leased worker protocol, fencing tokens, scanner adapters, policy evaluation, and Docker executor boundary | Scanner images, credentials, and external executor infrastructure are deployment inputs |
| Semantic search | Implemented authorization-aware embedding search, rebuildable indexes, and catalog search/status controls | Opt-in model credentials and the selected PostgreSQL/state index require deployment configuration |
| Install analytics | Implemented client-confirmed install receipts, bounded retention, and an admin report | Counts are best-effort telemetry; failed receipt delivery is not an install failure |
| Eve reviewer | Implemented a separate bounded Eve 0.52.3 reviewer that records human-review proposals | Eve cannot publish, merge, edit source, authorize installs, or run candidate content |
| CLI | Implemented Rust package and binary named `pskills`; the published [v0.3.0 release](https://github.com/andymac4182/private-skills/releases/tag/v0.3.0) passed archive/fresh-download verification and the Mac two-member inert fixture install/verify/warm repeat | The v0.2.0 package lacks feed, directory, and current pullthrough support; the v0.3.0 release evidence covers packaged loopback install/verify/warm behavior, not those compatibility surfaces or native CI. Linux-container and Windows-Wine checks are not native CI; native CI is waived for this delivery/review scope and no native target pass is claimed |
| skills.sh directory | Directory routes, source mapping, Topics parser, bounded cache, enumeration, multi-feed selection, and security checks are implemented in the current source | C1 telemetry/parser implementation is shipped in PR42/43; snapshot warm-cache reuse and source-scoped upstream fixtures are recorded, while hosted physical source resolution, concurrent cold deduplication, and tenant/secrecy acceptance remain open. Detailed deployment and evidence limits are in [`docs/verification-current.md`](docs/verification-current.md). |
| Sandbox providers | ComputeSDK abstraction with a tested Vercel adapter | Additional providers remain disabled until they pass the scanner isolation contract |

Implementation, deployment, scanner, schedule, and restore boundaries are
documented in [`docs/verification-current.md`](docs/verification-current.md).
Configuration and compatibility details remain in the linked component
documents; local fixtures do not replace live acceptance evidence.

## Quickstart

Use Node 24 and pnpm 11.19.0, matching [`.node-version`](.node-version) and `package.json`.

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm setup:dev --allow-unscanned
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm setup:dev --allow-unscanned` creates random local credentials and explicitly permits unreviewed releases for a disposable demo. Keep that mode local only. For a fail-closed setup, run `pnpm setup:dev` without the flag and configure the scanner worker before publishing releases; production must use a reviewed token, session secret, durable state provider, private storage, and scanner policy.

The development server normally listens on `http://localhost:5173`. Check the public route in another shell:

```sh
curl --fail http://localhost:5173/health
```

The root scripts are the supported local entry points:

```sh
pnpm build                         # TanStack/Nitro production output
pnpm check                         # TypeScript and Vitest
pnpm worker                        # external job and scanner worker
pnpm cli --help                    # Rust CLI through Cargo
cargo run -p pskills -- --help     # same CLI, package name is pskills
```

`pnpm worker` loads the optional local `.env` and requires `PSKILLS_API_URL`, `PSKILLS_WORKER_TOKEN`, and optionally `PSKILLS_WORKER_ID`, scanner image references, and polling settings. The worker is intended to run beside the API or as a separate service. See [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md) for the environment, storage, worker, and recovery procedures.

## Authentication and API

The browser sign-in form exchanges a configured user token with `POST /auth/session`. The server hashes configured token material at startup, signs a short-lived session, and returns it as an `HttpOnly` cookie. Cookie mutations require the configured origin. `DELETE /auth/session` clears the session. The CLI uses a scoped bearer token; `pskills login` currently accepts it through `--token-stdin`, so credentials do not appear in shell history.

The web surface calls the same-origin API and exposes the implemented registry areas:

- `GET /health`, `GET /v1/me`, and `GET /v1/capabilities`;
- catalog, skill detail, scan reports, publish, rescan, and revoke under `/v1/skills`, `/v1/scans`, and `/v1/publish`;
- operations under `/v1/operations`;
- exact-member packs under `/v1/packs`;
- external catalog browsing, official collections, audits, individual imports, and unlisted pack preview under `/v1/directory`;
- scanner policy under `/v1/policy`;
- approved upstream mappings and queued imports under `/v1/upstreams` and `/v1/imports`;
- audit records under `/v1/audit`;
- authorization-aware semantic search under `/v1/search`, `/v1/search/status`, and `/v1/search/reindex`;
- client-confirmed install telemetry under `/v1/install-authorizations`, `/v1/install-receipts`, and the admin-only `/v1/analytics` report;
- human review proposals under `/v1/reviews`; the separate Eve app calls only the fixed `/internal/reviewer/prepare` and `/internal/reviewer/complete` routes;
- worker-only claim, artifact, and completion routes under `/internal/jobs`.

The production state factory starts Cisco as `required`, NVIDIA Skillspector as
`advisory`, and SkillsGuard as `advisory`, with `allowUnscanned=false`.
Development starts all scanners as `disabled`; `pnpm setup:dev --allow-unscanned`
is an explicit disposable-demo override. Administrators can set each scanner
to `disabled`, `advisory`, or `required`; required evidence must be complete,
current, digest-bound, and free of configured blocking findings before a
release becomes approved.

## Search, analytics, and review

Semantic search is opt-in. Set `PSKILLS_AI_ENABLED=true` and configure the
embedding Gateway credentials and optional model/dimension settings. A Node
deployment uses pgvector when it has PostgreSQL metadata and otherwise uses the
exact StateRepository fallback; the current implementation has no libSQL/Turso
adapter. Search indexes only approved, authorized skill text and rechecks the
artifact and content digests before returning a result. See
[`docs/semantic-search.md`](docs/semantic-search.md) for the profile, limits,
reindex, and edge gateway boundaries.

Install analytics is based on receipts submitted by the CLI after its local
transaction commits. The admin report counts changed skill/pack resolutions
and up-to-date checks, with bounded one-retry delivery. It does not count
downloads or infer installs from transfer grants. See
[`docs/analytics.md`](docs/analytics.md) for the receipt contract and
retention limits.

The Eve reviewer compares a bounded approved-skill snapshot and records
suggestions for a human. Accepting a suggestion records a decision only: there
is no model auto-merge, publish, source edit, install authorization, or
candidate execution. See [`docs/eve-reviewer.md`](docs/eve-reviewer.md).

For Vercel Node deployments, the optional hosted worker route
`GET /internal/worker/run` requires `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` and
returns queue metadata only. The root Vercel fallback cron is `0 21 * * *`
UTC; successful publish/import/rescan requests also schedule a bounded drain of
up to two jobs through Nitro's `waitUntil` hook. Configure immutable scanner
image references, including a source-revision/artifact-digest snapshot for
SkillsGuard when used. This route is not available in the Cloudflare edge
runtime; see [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md).

## Data and trust boundaries

Published content is a canonical JSON document with format `pskills-bundle-v1`. Each file contains a safe relative path and padded base64 content. The validator bounds the bundle at 2,000 files, 10 MiB per decoded file, and 100 MiB expanded. Stored bytes are hashed as `sha256:<hex>`, uploaded to a fresh sealed object key, read back, and verified before the metadata record references them.

The HTTP request limit defaults to 3,000,000 bytes, including base64 overhead. This smaller inline upload limit also applies to worker import completion; increase `PSKILLS_MAX_BODY_BYTES` only on hosts whose request limits support it. Large multipart uploads are not implemented in this release.

The request handler owns authorization, resolution, policy state, and audit records. A worker performs upstream acquisition and scanner execution after claiming a durable job. Worker completion carries a lease/fencing token, the artifact digest, the policy revision, and normalized scan evidence. Required failures remain unavailable or quarantined; they cannot be turned into approved content by a client-side flag.
